`google-globe-trends` is a [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) application that visualizes Google Trends with `react-globe`. Data is fetched during build time using the `google-trends-api` library. This project is inspired by the wonderful [#metoorising](https://metoorising.withgoogle.com/) project. With most of interactive features supported by `react-globe`, this project aims to simplify building beautiful globe visualizations with Google Trends datasets.
